# <Vibe-Check>

## Description
A playlist generator that utilizes the spotify API to pull songs based on user input (Genre/Energy Level/Length). Our motivation for creating this application was to create something useful and fun for those times when you don't know exactly what you want to listen to, but you have an idea based on what mood or vibe your going for. During this project we learned how to work with API's and fetch the data we were looking for, and manipulate it to suit our application. We also got practice creating an original app from start to finish, with a deadline.


## Usage
To use the app, simply navigate to the deployed site(https://project-one-group-three.github.io/vibe-check/) and make your selections. You can also clone the entire repository at (https://github.com/project-one-group-three/vibe-check).
